            <h6 class="text-bold-600">Going deeper</h6>
            <p>Even though they are not mandatory, Angular was designed for the use of design patterns you may not be
              accustomed to, like reactive programming, unidirectional data flow and centralized state management.</p>
            <p>These concepts are difficult to resume in a few words, and despite being tightly related to each other
              they concern specific parts of an application flow, each being quite deep to learn on its own.</p>
            <p>You will essentially find here a list of good starting points to learn more on these subjects.</p>
